# CS330_OpenGL

# What design process did you follow for your project work?

This project was built iteratively, adding new features each week throughout the course. The design was built to encorporate OOP principles, which was useful in maintaining order in this codebase while working with OpenGL (which can get messy).

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project, besides being a great exercise in C++, taught us much more about working with APIs and the importance of documentation. We also gained experience in thinking through a project's architecture; thinking not only of the present requirements, but about how we may build in a way that we can be ready for future requirements or new features as well. 

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Working on 3D graphics directly with OpenGL was entirely new to me. There is a bit of artistic flair required along with the usual algorithmic thinking. Using scene references as we worked was a new strategy that helped to complete the 3D scene in a more realistic way. 

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

OpenGL provides a great set of tools which can be expanded into a whole set of technologies. Visualization is one of the most important ways humans and machines can interact, and the skills acquired here can be useful in many fields. For example, what we created in this project may be the building blocks of a game engine, a CAD program, or a simulation tool. This technology can be easily embedded into standalone programs or directly into web apps to create visualization.
